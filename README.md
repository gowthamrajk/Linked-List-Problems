# Linked-List-Problems

   This Module consists of several problems in LinkedList and some Optimised solutions like Floyd's algorithm for loop detection, merge sort, insertion sort, etc.. 

# Types of Linked List:
  1) Singly Linked List
  2) Doubly Linked List
  3) Circular Linked List
  
# Basic Operations on Linked List:
- Traversal: To traverse all the nodes one after another
- Insertion: To add a node at the given position
- Deletion: To delete a node
- Searching: To search an element(s) by value
- Updating: To update a node
- Sorting: To arrange nodes in a linked list in a specific order
- Merging: To merge two linked lists into one
